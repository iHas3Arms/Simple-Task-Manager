# Simple-Task-Manager
A simple task manager allowing users to temporarily store tasks which can be checked or removed. Will soon make use of local storage.

# First Push
Very simple task manager. No real use as of now. If I find no other projects to work on, I may introduce features such as local storage, due dates, structural systems (i.e. to-do, ongoing, and completed categories). IF I take this very far, I may introduce backend work to store data and logins for users.
